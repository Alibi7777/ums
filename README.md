#  University Management System

University Management System â€” a Spring Boot project for managing students, courses, and enrollments.
It implements basic CRUD operations, authentication with JWT, and role-based access control (ADMIN, TEACHER, STUDENT).


##  How to Run the Project

1. Install PostgreSQL and create a database named `ums`.
2. Make sure your `application.properties` is configured correctly:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ums
   spring.datasource.username=postgres
   spring.datasource.password=1234
   ```
3. Make sure you have **Maven** and **Java 21** installed.
4. Run the project using your IDE
